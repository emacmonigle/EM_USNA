Repository for the technical projects I worked on during my time at the U.S. National Arboretum

This figure was created to display the abundance of Holly (genus: Ilex) species native to the U.S. The data was sourced from USDA Plants in 2025. 

The data was cleaned and formatted in R. A for loop was created to determine the density of each species in each county in the U.S. This data was aggregated into a 'sum' column and exported into ArcGIS. The density was joined with the national county shapefile and each county was filled in according to this density.
